# Pathfinding-Visualizer
![Pathfinding Visualizer Demo](https://github.com/GaTheLy/Pathfinding-Visualizer/blob/main/assets/dijstra_demo.gif)<br>
This project was my final assignment for the Data Structure course at university. The program was made using Python, 
mainly utilizing the Pygame library. Initially, the base of this project was inspired by a YouTube video by max on tech. 
The link for the video and the code source will be provided at the end. <br>

## Technologies
- Language: Python 3.11
- Library used: Pygame, tkinter
- Data Structures: Graph, Stack, Queue

## Algorithms
The algorithms that can be displayed using this Pathfinding Visualizer program are as follows:
1. Breadth-First-Search
2. Dijkstra
3. Depth-First-Search

## Features <br>
Below, I will describe each feature of the Pathfinding Visualizer along with the explanation and the data structure used. <br>
* Main Menu <br>
  The main menu is quite simple, constructed with 3 buttons that lead the user to the Dijkstra page, the DFS page, and to Quit the program. <br>

* Set Start Node
* Set End Node (Target)
* Add/ Remove Wall(s)
* Clear the Grid
* Set Weight for Each Node
* Set Neighbours
